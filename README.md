# Telegram File Share Bot

A Telegram bot built with **Node.js** and the `node-telegram-bot-api` library, designed to share files through automatically generated links. Ideal for keeping files organized and secure in a storage group without exposing it directly to end users.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔗 Permanent Links**: Each file uploaded to the storage group receives a unique and permanent link.
- **🌐 Universal Access**: Links can be shared with anyone, even if they are not in the storage group.
- **🛡️ Enhanced Privacy**: Your original group (where you store the files) will not interact with the user, so if any file has copyright issues, the bot will bear the consequences, not the entire group with all your files (as this feature can encourage piracy, please use the bot wisely).
- **📂 Automatic Organization**: Files are managed automatically, without manual intervention.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Create a Telegram group** (preferably private) to serve as the file storage.
2. **Add the bot as an administrator** to the group, granting read and write permissions.
3. **Send a file to the group** and the bot will automatically generate a unique link.
4. **Share the link** with anyone; when clicked, the bot will send the corresponding file to the user.
